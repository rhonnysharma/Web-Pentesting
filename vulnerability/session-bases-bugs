Possible to invite any team member without being logged in. [ Session Management Issue ]
Hi,
I would like to report session management issue to you, while testing i found that we can easily invite or we can easily perform invite related action, 
even we logged out from the the account. This mean the session are not properly managed. 
I didn't checked the other functionality under session management but this can prove the session won't expired after the account admin logout from his account.

STEP TO REPRODUCE:
- Login to your account
- Go to the invite and intercept the invite request from the burp suite

- Now logout from your account and try to send the request again. The expectation is "Session Expired or Login to perform the action".
- but the request executing successfully without being logged in to account.
SOLUTION:
Instantly expire the session once the account admin logouts from his account.
Please let me know if you need any extra information
Impact
Once the session is hijacked, attacker can easily perform the request even the account admin revoke his session.

Session fixation on public talk links
- userA shares a talk room and protects it with a password
- userB opens links but doesn't enter the password yet
- Attacker steals the cookies from userB
- userB logs in
- attacker is now also able to read the conversation etc
Impact
In short the attacker is able to take over the session of the guest userB on this talk room.
The session id should be renewed once the password is entered.

Previously created sessions continue being valid after MFA activation

I found one issue related to your 2FA system on https://cs.money/security/

Steps To Reproduce:
- access the same account on https://cs.money/ in two devices
- on device 'A' go to https://cs.money/security/ > complete all steps to activate the 2FA system
- Now the 2FA is activated for this account
- back to device 'B' reload the page
The session still active

Impact
In this scenario when 2FA is activated the other sessions of the account are not invalidated.
2FA is required to login. I believe the expected and recommended behavior here is to terminate the other sessions> request a new login> request the 2FA code> so then give the account access again

summary: accounts that have changed email addresses still have permission to enter the store through another browser, so old emails can still have access to the store

steps for reproduction
Change your account email (the account has handled several stores) and confirm (I use Firefox)
The email account has been successfully replaced
open another browser (chrome beta) and log in with the old email, here you are asked to enter the code from the email and you have successfully logged in the account
Try opening your shop and logging in with your old email (here I was directed to enter and still have full access, even after changing my email address).
please see the https://150hy.myshopify.com store (test store) and ████@wearehackerone.com and ██████+top@wearehackerone.com accounts (password = ██████████)
Impact
access not revoke after changed email address on accounts shopify
