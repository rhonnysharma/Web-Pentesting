Permanent DOS for new users!

Steps To Reproduce:

Go to https://my.stripo.email/cabinet/#/register
Fill our Name,Email and Password field and intercept that request with burp suite
In request change "Name" value to https://google.com/
After doing that forward request and login with credentials!
You have to complete the setup-wizard in order to get access to account! but the victim won't be able to as the server doesn't accept invalid characters in name field 
resulting in permanent DOS!
Supporting Material/References:
I have provided STRIPO.mkv as video POC where the same things have been explained and demonstrated!

Impact
The attacker might target single/multiple new user and reproduce this bug in order to DOS 
their account permanently and also this makes their mail unusable for your service and they have to use new mail in order to use your service
