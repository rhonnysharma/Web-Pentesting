Previously created sessions continue being valid after MFA activation

I found one issue related to your 2FA system on https://cs.money/security/

Steps To Reproduce:
- access the same account on https://cs.money/ in two devices
- on device 'A' go to https://cs.money/security/ > complete all steps to activate the 2FA system
- Now the 2FA is activated for this account
- back to device 'B' reload the page
The session still active

Impact
In this scenario when 2FA is activated the other sessions of the account are not invalidated.
2FA is required to login. I believe the expected and recommended behavior here is to terminate the other sessions> request a new login> request the 2FA code> so then give the account access again
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information disclosure -> 2fa bypass -> POST exploitation

Steps to reproduction :
first login into algolia.com and then
Go to "https://www.algolia.com/account/support"
There will be 2 buttons : "Revoke" and "Renew", click on "Renew" and intercept that request using proxy like burp suite
Now send that request to repeater and forward that request
In repeater, replay the request and check response and look for "gauth_secret" and then copy the value of that key
download google authenticator app and then paste it , then it will show the codes
Now u can execute actions as you know the 2fa codes now!

Impact
Since there are checks implemented for every critical action , i think the leakage of "gauth_secret" here let attacker bypass those checks by knowing 2fa
So now the attacker can delete account, update email and do much more critical actions and totally compromise victims account

Solution : Don't leak the gauth_secret in response
